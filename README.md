# Design and Build a Fictitious Theme Park Website.

## Instructions:
Develop the website in four stages

## Part 1 
### Design Specification:

### Agree on the Purpose of the Website

Discuss the reasons for a theme park operator to have a website, the people who might look at such a website, and the reasons that they would be looking at the website.

### Research Theme Park Websites

Choose five different websites for theme parks. Review the type of information you find on the sites, and the structure that these sites have to help people locate that information. Make a list of the aspects of the sites that you think are a good idea or that work well, and those that you don't think are so successful. This will give you some insights you can use when designing your website. 

### Agree on the Content for the Website

Determine the theme for your theme park and the types of attractions you will have for the different visitors you expect to come. Think of any other services you will provide visitors (for example, food, access to money, and medical help). Think of any other information people looking at your website will want to know before visiting your theme park. Keep a record of your decisions in a document.

### Agree on the Structure of the Website

Decide on the structure of your website, to design a website with 3 pages. What information will appear on the main page, and what will appear on the other two pages? Think about how you might present the content, and whether you will have semantic parts such as asides or pop-up windows. Keep a record of your decisions in a document.

### Design the Wireframes for the Website

Produce a set of wireframes for the site, showing the concepts for both wide and small screens. These can either be drawn by hand or produced using a tool such as PowerPoint or a graphics package such as Illustrator. Avoid painting or photo-editing software such as Paint or Photoshop as designs produced this way are difficult to edit. Ensure that the designs are clear and easy to read.



## Part 2
### Build the HTML Pages:

### Markup wireframes with HTML

Review the three wireframes you produced for the large screen version of your website from part 1 of the team project and make any changes you think would improve them. Work through the wireframes and decide on the correct HTML to build those pages. Think carefully about using layout tags such as tables, and only use them where the content is a table. Make sure that all the parts of the pages have a semantic identity, either by using existing semantic tags or by defining "div" tags for the content. Attempt to use a range of the various formatting tags available to add richness and extra meaning to your content. Consider how different media can add to how your pages communicate information.

### Code HTML pages

Write the HTML code and enter some essential text content. Name the main/first page of your website: index.html. Ensure you use comments to help understand the code.

Find pictures and any other media you consider appropriate and embed them into the pages using the correct HTML tags. Ensure that your code includes comments to help you work with the code and quickly relate it to the wireframes.

## Part 3
### Markup wireframes with Appearance CSS:

Review the three wireframes you produced for the large screen version of your website from part 2 of the project and add to them to ensure they have the appearance you wish your site to have. Pick the colors that will be applied to the elements, including a font family or specific font that you will use for different parts of your site.

### Set up and link stylesheet

Code the CSS stylesheet with these appearance styling instructions and link them to the correct HTML elements using the class and id mechanism.

## Part 4
### Markup wireframes with Layout CSS:

Review the three wireframes  you produced for the large screen version of your web site from part 3 of the project and add to them to ensure they have the layout you wish your site to have. In particular, identify the HTML elements' absolute and relative positions taking the element enclosing hierarchy in your website. Use the various ways of measuring elements on web pages as appropriate. Additionally, identify the boxes that enclose the HTML elements in your website and consider the box properties (padding borders, etc) that you want to define.

Work through the wireframes decide on the correct CSS to build those pages, and check the class and identity properties of the elements in the pages. Mark up your wireframes accordingly. Upload these new marked-up versions of the wireframes a .zip file into the Workspace: static web pages in week 10.

Set up and link stylesheet

Code the CSS stylesheet with the layout styling instructions and link them to the correct HTML elements using the class and id mechanism.
